Sorting2 is a sorting algorithm that implements quicksort and insertionsort on n objects. If the list of sorted objects is less than 64, 
insertion sort is implemented to sort the remaining objects. 

Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm that is used to detect primes. We start by having an array of integers n, and we initalize every 
integer to be true. The algorithm then checks from 2 to sqrt(n), and changes the multiples of n to false (since they would have a common
divisor). When the algorithm is complete, the remaining true values will all be prime.
