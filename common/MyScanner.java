/* MyScanner is a "wrapper class" for java.util.Scanner. 
 * 
 * The problem with Scanner is that it does not advance to the next 
 * line in the input stream after it gets numeric data (as most people
 * would expect it to do).
 * 
 * MyScanner fixes this problem by "redefining" the way that nextInt()
 * and nextDouble() work. In MyScanner, they do advance to the next 
 * line in the input stream after reading the numeric data.
 * 
 *   nextDouble(): get a double value from the user then advance to the 
 *     next line in the input stream.
 *   nextInt(): get an int value from the user then advance to the 
 *     next line in the input stream.
 *   nextString(): return a string containing all the character data
 *     on the line (and advance to the next line in the input stream).
 *   close(): close out the private Scanner object so that there are
 *     no memory leaks.
 *
